### 🛠️ Tips for Choosing

* **Start simple:** Begin with free plans and test usage limits (e.g., 50–1,000 interactions per month).
* **Integration matters:** If you already use tools like HubSpot CRM or Shopify, pick chatbots that plug directly into them.
* **Lead focus vs support focus:** Some bots are great at *lead capture* while others excel at *customer support flows*.
